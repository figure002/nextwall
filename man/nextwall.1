.SH NAME
nextwall - A wallpaper rotator with some sense of time.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nextwall
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] \fI\,PATH\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Nextwall
is a small application that changes the background of the GNOME desktop to a
random image. The fit time of day feature automatically sets backgrounds that
fit the time of the day (dark backgrounds at night, bright backgrounds at day,
intermediate at twilight). It uses an Artificial Neural Network to determine
the brightness of a wallpaper.

When running
.B nextwall
for the first time, you need to scan your wallpaper directory for wallpapers:

	nextwall -sr \fIPATH\fR

While it scans for wallpapers, it defines the brightness for each wallpaper.
